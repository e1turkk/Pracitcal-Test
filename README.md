How the DVSA - LIMITED Plan works (MUST READ):

    • You purchase the plan for £105
    • If you fail the test, you must pay the DVSA booking price but will not have to pay the extra fee that we charge, so for example:
    • You want to do another test between Monday - Friday 10am - 5pm (excluding Bank Holidays) you must send £62 (as per DVSA price)
    • So you will only need to pay DVSA price whether it is £62 or £75

FAQ:

    Q: Difference between £62 Practical Exam and £75 Practical Exam?
        A: DVSA charges for 2 different exams, one is flexible which is £75 and other is £62

    Q: Difference between flexible & normal?
        A: Flexible means you can choose to book your exam for Weekend, Weekday, Bank Holidays, Mornings, Afternoons and Evenings.
            Whereas a normal would be strictly Morning, Afternoon & only during Weekdays (excluding Bank Holidays)

£62 = Normal | £75 = Flexible
